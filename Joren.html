                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>2 star anise pods</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
                <li>1 1” piece ginger, peeled, crushed</li>
                <li>8 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 bone-in pork shoulder steaks (about 12 oz. each)</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>8 ounces thin rice stick noodles</li>
                <li>Mung bean sprouts, fresh cilantro leaves with tender stems, thinly sliced scallions, chopped unsalted, roasted peanuts, and lime wedges (for serving)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preperation</h3>
            <p>Heat a dry large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook onion, cut side down, until lightly charred, about 5 minutes; transfer to a plate.</p>

            <p>Add chiles (if using crushed red pepper flakes, add with fennel seeds), garlic, cinnamon stick, and star anise to skillet and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add fennel seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds (do not burn). Quickly transfer to a large saucepan (reserve skillet) and add onion, ginger, and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until broth is flavorful.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, heat oil in reserved skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly slicing.</p>

            <p>Cook noodles according to package directions. Divide among bowls; add pork. Strain broth and ladle into bowls. Top pho with bean sprouts, cilantro, scallions, and peanuts and serve with lime wedges.</p>
